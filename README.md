## ChipWhisperer 6.0: Repo Changes and Cleanup

ChipWhisperer 6.0 is bringing many changes to the ChipWhisperer repository. The biggest one is a cleanup of the git history on both this repo and
chipwhisperer-jupyter, as well as moving some files out of these repositories. We've done our best to make everything most users will want
on this repo, as well as to backup everything else to other repos.

## What is ChipWhisperer?

ChipWhisperer is an open source toolchain dedicated to hardware security research. This toolchain consists of several layers of open source components:
* __Hardware__: The ChipWhisperer uses a _capture_ board and a _target_ board. Schematics and PCB layouts for the ChipWhisperer-Lite capture board and a number of target boards are freely available.
* __Firmware__: Three separate pieces of firmware are used on the ChipWhisperer hardware. The capture board has a USB controller (in C) and an FPGA for high-speed captures (in Verilog) with open-source firmware. Also, the target device has its own firmware; this repository includes many firmware examples for different targets.
* __Software__: The ChipWhisperer software includes a Python API for talking to ChipWhisperer hardware (ChipWhisperer Capture) and a Python API 
for processing power traces from ChipWhisperer hardware (ChipWhisperer Analyzer). 

You'll find documentation for all of the above [here](https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io).

## Getting Started
First time using ChipWhisperer? Go to our new [documentation site](https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io) for all you need to know to get started with ChipWhisperer.

## GIT Source
Note all development occurs on the [develop](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/tree/develop) branch. If you are looking for bleeding edge it's NOT on master - we push each release (and possibly any critical changes) to master. This means that "master" always gives you the latest known-working branch, but there may be new features on the "develop" branch.

## Help!
Stuck? If you need a hand, there are a few places you can ask for help:
* The [NewAE Forum](https://forum.newae.com/) is full of helpful people that can point you in the right direction
* If you find a bug, let us know through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/issues)
